      <h2>Net-Centric Tools </h2>
      <p>Over the past week, i was introduced to several networking tools like ping, netstat, 
traceroute, and dig that helps us to understand how computers communicate over a network. We 
discuss what we've learned in details below.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ping:</strong> I learned that ping is used to test connectivity between 
my computer and another device. It also shows how long it takes for a packet to travel to the destination and back. For example, 
pinging Google’s server gives me the round-trip time in milliseconds.</li>

        <li><strong>Netstat:</strong> Using netstat was interesting because it let me see 
all the active connections on my computer. I could tell which IP addresses my computer was talking to, what ports were open, and 
even identify the default route my packets take when leaving my network.</li>

        <li><strong>Traceroute:</strong> With traceroute, I could actually see the 
path my data takes across the internet. It lists each “hop” along the way from my computer to the destination server, showing the different 
routers that handle the packet. It really shows how complex the internet’s routing system is.</li>

        <li><strong>Dig:</strong> Finally, dig gave me a deeper understanding of the Domain Name 
System (DNS).Instead of just typing in a website name and getting the page, I used dig to look up DNS records. For example, I 
was able to see how a website name like www.cnn.com gets translated into multiple IP addresses 
for load distribution.</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Overall, working with these tools gave me a better appreciation of how much is happening 
behind the scenes every time we open a website and I can not wait to learn even more about the 
activities that happen over a network.</p>
